- It's a good idea to wrap <Text> elements in a <View> element for more styling options.

- ScrollView is another important component in ReactNative and must be explicitly imported at the top ---> 

import { StyleSheet, Text, View, TextInput, Button, ScrollView })

- by adding horizontal as an attribute, you can scroll sideways if necessary.

"<ScrollView horizontal>"
